# AlphaImpact
Token contract for Alpha Impact

Bots adapt to every new launch in the blockchain ecosystem, and as such, anti-bot measures must be revised consistently on each new deployment. Even aggressive measures prove obsolete after 1–2 uses, however, we are optimistic that our latest approach will shift the paradigm in anti-botting technology. Instead of fighting bots in individual battles, we have decided to win the war by forcing them to be part of our ecosystem.
For full transparency with our community and the space as a whole, we have outlined the detailed vesting approach that we will employ at launch:
1. Only 1 transaction allowed per wallet within the first 10 minutes of launch.
2. Smart contracts other than the whitelisted ones are banned for the first 10 minutes.
3. This transaction will have a maximum transfer limit and a maximum gas price — with each launch, these values may differ.
4. Transactions that are less than 10x the launch price will have a portion of their tokens vested.
  The calculation for tokens vested is as follows:
    a. For example, buying at 2.3x launch price = “2.3”/10 as a % unlocked, or 23% of purchased tokens unlocked immediately.
    b. Remaining tokens are vested for (20–2 “X”) days. For example, buying at 2.3x launch price implies 20 days–2(2.3)days = 15.4 days of lock time for 77% of the remaining tokens.

The above restrictions expire after 10 minutes, and are executed within the smart contract.
